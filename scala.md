## sbt: Running commands in cli

`sbt` interprets each command line argument provided to it as a command together
with the commandâ€™s arguments. Therefore, to run a command that takes arguments
in batch mode, quote the command using double quotes, and its arguments. For
example,

```sh
sbt "project X" clean "~ compile"
```

## sbt: Temporarily switch to a different Scala version

The scalaVersion configures the version of Scala used for compilation. By
default, sbt also adds a dependency on the Scala library with this version.

```scala
scalaVersion := "2.11.1"
```

To set the Scala version in all scopes to a specific value, use the `++`
command. For example, to temporarily use Scala `2.10.4`, run:

```sbt
> ++ 2.10.4
```
