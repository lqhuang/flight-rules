title: Get "Everything" You Need about Network by `ip` and `jq`

I didn't rely on `jq` too much before, though I know it's a powerful tool to parse JSON in cli.

However, my thoughts changed after I read the post [Getting the active network interface(s) in a script on Ubuntu 22.04](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/GetActiveNetworkInterfaces). Just knowing the `ip` command can output JSON format, what amazing thing!

```sh-session
$ ip -json route show default
[{"dst":"default","gateway":"192.168.1.1","dev":"eno1","protocol":"dhcp","prefsrc":"192.168.1.217","metric":100,"flags":[]}]
```

Now the whole world becomes clearer with an unified and pretty interface by `jq` and without the need for `awk` / `sed` / `tr` / etc.

```sh-session
$ ip -json addr show default | jq
[
  {
    "dst": "default",
    "gateway": "192.168.1.1",
    "dev": "eno1",
    "protocol": "dhcp",
    "prefsrc": "192.168.1.217",
    "metric": 100,
    "flags": []
  }
]
$ ip -json addr show default | jq -r .[0].dev
eno1
```

I think I will add `jq` to my must-install list soon. As Chris Siebenmann said,

I have to admit JSON may not be the best format for human-readable output, but it's at least not that bad either.
