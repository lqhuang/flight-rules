To sort the output of `du -h` by size, you can use the following command:

```sh
# list in ascending order (smallest first)
du -h -d 1 | sort -n
# reverse order to list in descending (largest first)
du -h -d 1 | sort -nr
```

where the options for `sort` are:

```man
  -n, --numeric-sort          compare according to string numerical value
  -r, --reverse               reverse the result of comparisons
```

In modern versions of unix-like distribution, you can also use the `-h` option instead of `-n`:

```man
  -n, --numeric-sort          compare according to string numerical value
  -r, --reverse               reverse the result of comparisons
```

So, the following command will also work both in macOS and Linux:

```sh
du -h -d 1 | sort -h
```
