# Flight Rules for Codes

This has been inspired by
[k88hudson](https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules) where they quote:

**What are "flight rules"?**

A [guide for astronauts](https://www.jsc.nasa.gov/news/columbia/fr_generic.pdf)
(now, programmers using Git) about what to do when things go wrong.

> _Flight Rules_ are the hard-earned body of knowledge recorded in manuals that
> list, step-by-step, what to do if X occurs, and why. Essentially, they are
> extremely detailed, scenario-specific standard operating procedures. [...]

> NASA has been capturing our missteps, disasters and solutions since the early
> 1960s, when Mercury-era ground teams first started gathering "lessons learned"
> into a compendium that now lists thousands of problematic situations, from
> engine failure to busted hatch handles to computer glitches, and their
> solutions.
